## Abstract

We study temporal step size control of explicit Runge-Kutta methods for
compressible computational fluid dynamics (CFD), including the Navier-Stokes
equations and hyperbolic systems of conservation laws such as the Euler equations.
We demonstrate that error-based approaches
are convenient in a wide range of applications and compare them to more classical
step size control based on a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number. Our numerical
examples show that error-based step size control is easy to use, robust, and efficient,
e.g., for (initial) transient periods, complex geometries, nonlinear shock
capturing approaches, and schemes that use nonlinear entropy projections.
We demonstrate these properties for problems ranging from well-understood
academic test cases to industrially relevant large-scale computations with two
disjoint code bases, the open source Julia packages Trixi.jl with OrdinaryDiffEq.jl
and the C/Fortran code SSDC based on PETSc.

## Numerical experiments

The numerical experiments presented in the paper use [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl)
and SSDC.
To reproduce the numerical experiments using Trixi.jl, you need to install
[Julia](https://julialang.org/).

The subfolders of this repository contain `README.md` files with instructions
to reproduce the numerical experiments, including postprocessing.

The numerical experiments were carried out using Julia v1.7.
